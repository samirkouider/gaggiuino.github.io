# 1.0.0 TEST INSTALL
We are not installing inside the machine yet. We need to ensure our nano and expansion board are soldered to a good standard. We just want to test as much as we can to make sure we've not got any duds from a base functionality point of view.

We need to understand what goes where. The schematics in [3.1.0 Schematics and Diagrams](#_310-schematics-and-diagrams) aren't really rocket science but for someone who's never disassembled or has no experience working with electrical circuits it might get confusing really fast. 

Note 1 - No permanent connections are needed during testing so no soldering needed for now.
Note 2 - The 5v/GND Arduino board pins will be shared between all the connected devices.

?>All component wiring tables are in the appendix at the end [3.2.0 Component Wiring](#_320-component-wiring).

## 1.0.1 Arduino Config 
Place Arduino into the expansion board the correct way round. Power it through USB adapter for now during the testing phase.

Image of Arduino with pins soldered:

Make sure the terminals are correct way round and place the Arduino into the expansion board.

?>You must solder your pins and take the time now to get your soldering perfect. It'll save time in the long run. **Refer to [Recommendations](learning/learning-sources.md) for soldering!**

!>**Attention! You are not soldering the Arduino to the expansion board itself. You are only soldering the pins to the Arduino and pins to the expansion board. The Arduino then just sits/connects into the expansion board pins.**

?>Any wires going to the expansion board itself will be **26AWG**.

## 1.0.2 Thermocouple MAX6675 Config
You should have bought and received a MAX6675 board which comes with a test thermocouple. We're swapping this for the **C-M4 screw K-Type thermocouple sensor** as this is what will be replacing the original that's in the machine.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154988392-619a5bc2-99cc-499d-8ad8-42792b094fd2.jpg ':size=500')

?>Refer to the [3.2.2 Component Wiring](#_322-thermocouple-max6675) section on wiring to the arduino.
## 1.0.3 Solid State Relay Config
This relay is what manages the temp by cutting the voltage when the thermocouple is at a set temp. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154988554-5be0bb0a-dcf2-4bf7-a70f-4c356d00eea6.jpg ':size=500')

?>Refer to the [3.2.3 Component Wiring](#_323-solid-state-relay) section on wiring to the arduino.
## 1.0.4 Nextion LCD Config
The correct screen size is **2.4"**. If yours does not have markings for wiring then please see below image

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154988491-28c1e861-46bc-433b-a5f8-8e9eeb8b51ed.png ':size=500')

?>Refer to the [3.2.4 Component Wiring](#_324-nextion-lcd-display) section on wiring to the arduino.
## 1.0.5 Software Install
To flash the Arduino Nano microcontroller, pls follow the video from the [Prerequisites](prereq/prerequisites.md) section of this site.

!>Arduino Nano won't flash with the LCD attached to the RX/TX pins so make sure to disconnect it at that time.

**Flashing the Nextion LCD Software Upload**

_Uploading the LCD Firmware_

Download and unzip the *.tft file on a FAT32(MS-DOS (FAT32)) formatted microSD card and upload on the LCD panel using the onboard card reader.

1. Plug LCD back into Arduino Board Setup.
2. Locate “nextion-discovery-lcd.tft” or “nextion-basic-lcd.tft” (depends on what you purchased).
3. Copy the file to a FAT32 formatted MicroSD card.
* If on Mac for some reason it adds a second file beginning with a "." use terminal to change.directory to the microSD and use "rm ._nextion-*YOUR-VERSION*-lcd.tft" to remove that file.
4. Place MicroSD card inside the Nextion display.
5. Power on the Arduino Board Setup and installation should occur automatically.
6. Once “successed” turn power off and remove the MicroSD card, only now setup can be powered.

## 1.0.6 Test
You should now see the Gaggiuino project on the LCD. If your connections are all right (and well secured), you should see a temperature reading from the thermocouple (temp reading will contain the default offset of 7 which means the initial temp will be - room temp -7)

Try applying heat with your hand and you should see the temperature respond (if not, I recommend confirming all connections are correct and adequately tightened.  Mine did not respond at first and turned out one of the connections to the Arduino board was not tight enough)

If everything looks good, move on to Installing into the Gaggia Classic Pro

**If all the above works as expected you're ready to install it inside the machine.**

# 2.0.0 INSTALL
***
!>**Do not underestimate the danger of electricity or overestimate your ability to work around it. Only start working on your machine while it's completely disconnected from the mains power socket, also by agreeing to follow the below guide I cannot be deemed responsible for any of the damage you induce to your house appliances, yourself, your cat, friend or goldfish and it will be entirely your fault!**
***

Undo everything as we will now install into the machine. 

All components except the Arduino and LCD will be internal to the machine. Remember this when wiring the LCD. 

For each of the components we want to start guesstimating on cable length. You can do this by placing components where you want to place them. Close together components can share similar wiring i.e. 5v and GND.

?>Please use the tables in [3.2.0 Component Wiring](#_320-component-wiring) for details on pin connections to the Arduino. 

## 2.1.0 Base Functionality
### 2.1.1 Power Delivery
Take off the top cover of your machine by unscrewing the 2 top screws. Be sure to mark your top left power connector so you don't mix them up (even though it's not that hard to understand which one is which).

Prepare splitter cables with the below specs:
1. Black splitter, 18AWG, 10cm, female end, male end, male end.
2. Red splitter, 18AWG, 10cm, female end, male end, male end.

Example of a red and black splitter:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154988645-5f1da175-7d09-437a-ac2c-f64e16f3a564.jpg ':size=350')

The female spade end will go in Gaggia's front panel. One male splitter end will go into the connection that came out of the switch position the other male will be for some more wires further down.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154988784-7ddbc106-4744-4d9f-8879-b9a107a9fe7c.jpg ':size=350')

Before trying to copy piggyback locations from below it’s recommended to check what the schematics say [3.1.0 Schematics & Diagrams](#_310-schematics-and-diagrams).

?>**PLEASE NOTE THE OFFICIAL SCHEMATIC DRAWINGS HAVE BEEN DRAWN FLIPPED AND UPSIDE DOWN**

Whilst following schematics it's important to test you have found the correct piggyback locations. In order to do this please follow the below instructions before turning on your machine.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154982423-82b4bdb4-ca78-4077-90c0-77b349c8c3d2.JPG ':size=350')

* Set it to 600V~ (AC) as shown above and test the connectors on the switches
* Just wiggle the connector on the switch out a touch to expose a tiny bit of metal where you put your lead on
* Use schematic to find a GND point
* Your live piggyback will show no voltage until the machine is switched on

As stated you want to find the connector that only shows voltage after flipping the machine machine on. 

If your LCD is on even though you've not flipped the machine switch on, this means you've piggybacked into the mains live which is constantly got voltage - this is not correct!

Please see some examples of known differences between piggyback location but really you should be testing with a multimeter.

<!-- tabs:start -->
<!-- tab:Gaggia Classic Pro -->
By way of context, if looking inside the machine from the back, the left of the power switch is the brew switch. 

**Below is a snippet of the power switch which is in the schematics. The red box is showing example of where piggyback should connect.**

On the power switch - wire in the middle **left** as LIVE and middle **right** as GND.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154979422-f78d41c4-87f4-4474-ab68-a3466d5e9e5e.jpeg ':size=350')

Above translates to the following **(please be aware the image below has top connectors removed for clarity)**:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154979529-eae513b2-00e3-40c9-a581-47be4da68edc.jpg ':size=350')

<!-- tab: Gaggia New Classic (auto shut-off) -->
?>You can identify if you have an ECO machine (usually sold in EU/UK) if your machine turns off automatically after 20mins.

Firstly refer to section [2.1.2 Disable ECO timer](#_212-disable-eco-timer). If you decide to remove/bypass your ECO PCB then use the **Gaggia Classic Pro** tab.

The LIVE is the top right of the **brew** switch and the GND is top right of the **power** switch.

![eco-power](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/210780103-6d9e9c78-6349-4a30-be2e-2298040e17a3.png ':size=350')
<!-- tabs:end -->

Prepare 2 more cables with the below spec:
1. Black, 18AWG, about 15cm, female spade end, exposed end.
2. Red, 18AWG, about 15cm, female spade end, exposed end.

Connect the female end to the male end of the splitter cable from above step (match the colours).

On the 12v PSU the 2 AC IN ports will be where the exposed end of your red or black piggyback cable go, it doesn't matter which way round (yes, you need to fiddle about getting wires in and solder correctly - recommended to trim, twist, tin and apply heat shrink).

Prepare more cables with the below spec:
1. Black, 18AWG, about ~10cm, exposed ends.
2. Red, 18AWG, about ~10cm, exposed ends.
3. Black, 26AWG, about ~25cm, exposed ends.
4. Red, 26AWG, about ~25cm, exposed ends.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/210059859-be0135a8-7041-48ab-a2a5-daa8c86d04a1.png" ':size=500')

In relation to the image above - 
- The short red 18AWG wire goes from 12v VCC/+ -> 5V IN + 
- The short black 18AWG wire goes from 12v GND/- -> 5V IN -  
- The longer 26AWG black will be connected from 5v OUT- to the GND of expansion
- The longer 26AWG red will be connected from 5v OUT+ to the 5V of expansion. 

!>**Make sure this component is well insulated and enclosed. You do not want to touch it or let it make contact with anything whilst the machine is on!**

?>Refer to the [3.2.1 Component Wiring](#_321-power-delivery) section on wiring to the arduino.
### 2.1.2 Disable ECO timer
!>**SKIP TO 2.1.3 IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ECO MACHINE** 

?>You can identify if you have an ECO machine (usually sold in EU/UK) if your machine turns off automatically after 20mins. This requires you to look at the [schematics](#_310-schematics-and-diagrams). 

Prepare the following cable to the below spec:

1. Red, 18AWG, 5cm, two male spade ends.

This step is straight forward, with the 18AWG cable, bridge the top and bottom (switch poles 1 & 2) that sit on the left of the brew switch. This will disable the 20mins timer. It does not however completely bypass ECO board. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154989122-6237e1af-62d1-4289-901c-47c69ea3b1b9.jpg ':size=350')

?>If you plan on going through the GAGGIUINO PCB install, it is recommended to get rid of or completely [bypass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNs3uSLA4Ts&t=199s) the ECO PCB. Steps for removing the ECO PCB are not provided as there are other resources on the web on how to do this. It's also pretty trivial. **If you do get rid of the ECO PCB then follow standard Gaggia Classic Pro instructions.**

### 2.1.3 Thermocouple MAX6675
Prepare the following cable to the below spec:

1. Black, 18AWG, 5cm, two male ends.

 [Detach the boiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipvBdWaVzQ) (only watch as far as the 5min mark) to gain enough access to remove the thermocouple and replace it with the m4 bolted thermocouple sensor. 

You’ll obviously need to remove the two connectors from the original thermostat first - which is located at the bottom of the boiler on the side closest to the power on switch.  

The small black cable you prepared with the male spade ends is used to bridge the two wires that you just disconnected from the brew thermostat. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154983715-46b1332f-f88a-4ef3-a625-b7f2788caf97.jpeg ':size=350')

Now unscrew the original thermostat and replace with the m4 brass thermocouple. Be sure to apply some thermal paste (just a teeny tiny bit) on the _**threads only**_. 

!>It is important to tighten the m4 bolt at **barely** fingertip strength. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154989188-6bc38c2c-60df-47f6-98d9-b121f28438d6.jpg ':size=350')

?>Refer to the [3.2.2 Component Wiring](#_322-thermocouple-max6675) section on wiring to the arduino.
### 2.1.4 Solid State Relay
Prepare cables with below spec:

1. Red, 18AWG, 10cm, one male spade end, one exposed end.
2. Red, 18AWG, 10cm, one male spade end, one exposed end.

The 2 are used to connect the steam thermostat connections to port 1 and 2 of the Solid State Relay, so:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154989308-14e9ea82-8a60-4f3d-bd9f-05dda6fa15c8.JPG ':size=350')

Optional: might be a good idea to either tape up the exposed steam thermostat or remove it and tape up the exposed location.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154989373-57093be0-ac48-4ac6-ad0b-d88adc2415d9.jpg ':size=350')

?>Refer to the [3.2.3 Component Wiring](#_323-solid-state-relay) section on wiring to the arduino.
### 2.1.5 Steam Handling
!>**Very important to NOT turn on the machine until we check the steam switch wire positions**

<!-- tabs:start -->
<!-- tab:Gaggia Classic Pro -->
Image of the steam switch schematic:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154989457-f5ac859e-5aa5-4554-be46-fba6ad4fa1f0.png ':size=350')

1. Move steam switch wire 4 to steam switch pole 1.
2. Unplug and secure steam switch wire 5.
3. Connect steam switch poles 4 and 5 to the Arduino nano as shown in [3.2.5 Component Wiring](#_325-steam-handling), using 26AWG wires.

<!-- tab:Gaggia New Classic (auto shut-off) -->
Prepare a black splitter with below spec:
1. Black splitter, 18AWG, 5cm, two male spade ends and one female spade end.

1. Disconnect the two top poles (1 & 4).
2. Use the splitter to bridge the connections you just removed and plug the female into pole 1.
3. The connector with two white wires is not on the side of the orange wire (which is at the bottom) then make it so (to match schematics) - i.e move pole 5 connector into pole 2's location (should be two white wires going into the connector).
4. Leave the single white wire disconnected which was in pole 2's location.
3. Connect steam switch poles 4 and 5 to the Arduino nano as shown in [3.2.5 Component Wiring](#_325-steam-handling), using 26AWG wires.

Image for reference below:

<!-- tabs:end -->

### 2.1.6 Continuity Brew Detection
Prepare 2 cables with the below spec:
1. Green (not red or black), 26AWG, length from brew to Arduino, one exposed end, one female spade end.
2. Black, 26AWG, length from brew to Arduino, one exposed end, one female spade end.

As shown below plug your cables in to the circled connections on the brew switch:  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154985120-fe503708-50c1-4376-9459-d72312fbbadc.jpeg ':size=350')

?>Refer to the [3.2.6 Component Wiring](#_326-continuity-brew-detection) section on wiring to the arduino.
## 2.2.0 Extended Functionality
### 2.2.1 RobotDYN Dimmer
Prepare 3 cables with the below spec:
1. Red, 18AWG, 15cm, one exposed end, one female spade end.
2. Red, 18AWG, 15cm, one exposed end, one male spade end.
3. Black splitter, 18AWG, 15cm, one exposed end, one male spade end, one female spade end.

!>Please check whether your dimmer ports placement in the case it differs from the images before connecting the dimmer, it's very important to feed the IN and OUT wires correctly!

Example of dimmer ports:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154989499-7e95ca82-f8eb-4f63-b57b-3ca1e7e14eeb.png ':size=350')

Remove the connections detailed in the image below from the pump (mark the connector either L or R for where it was located either left or right in relation to the pump):-

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/154989519-4e5ba059-22a4-4397-8dfb-5b7dff411bbf.jpg ':size=350')

With the cables you prepared:
* Cable 1: From the dimmer positive line Out - single red wire with the female end going into one of (choose the left connection according to the image above) the pump connections itself. 

* Cable 2: From the dimmer positive line In - single red wire with the male end going into the connector that was removed from the pump above (in this case it would be the left connector).

* Cable 3: From the dimmer neutral line In - with the black splitter with the male into the connector taken out of the pump (right connector) and female into the (right) remaining connection on the pump itself.

!>**Triple check your dimmer board on what is marked as IN and OUT. 100% need to make sure they are connected properly.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/155005284-b22a6652-87b0-42db-9d35-5d2bc8b9247e.jpg ':size=350')

?>Refer to the [3.2.7 Component Wiring](#_327-robotdyn-dimmer) section on wiring to the arduino.
### 2.2.2 Pressure Transducer
The pressure sensor will be tapping into the orange braided hose connecting the pump outlet and the boiler inlet. 

!>**There is no need to take off your original saeco hose.** 

Splice into it from the centre and add the T fitting with clamps. Add the additional/new hose to the free T end with clamps and to the other side, the fitting with clamps and tighten the pressure sensor on to it with teflon tape. 

It's advisable after making the connections and just before connecting the transducer itself turn on the machine and while cold engage the pump to fill the transducer hose with water as well, leaving a lot of air in the system might play funny with the readings.

**Try to keep the sensor itself away from HV lines and also the pump itself. This will help reduce noise.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53577819/210058187-e04d976e-cc38-43f1-90fd-3a380e603ef7.png ':size=500')

?>Refer to the [3.2.8 Component Wiring](#_328-pressure-transducer) section on wiring to the arduino.
### 2.2.3 Finish
***
If you haven't already, you're ready to connect everything to the Arduino. Use [3.2.0 Component Wiring](#_320-component-wiring) for quickly referencing all components. 

One piece of advice would be to solder all cables to their respective boards as during the machine operation there is quite a bit of vibration which can introduce noise/frequent. This can lead to unexplained behaviours.

Any components sitting next to each other can have their equivalent pins linked with a cable.

You will be expected to solder similar pins i.e. all GND and all 5v together in order to fit into and screw down on the expansion board terminals. You can use either WAGOS for this or using some strip-board. 

?>Please refer to [Lego Component Housing Guide](guides/lego-component-build-guide.md) on how to setup and house your components for best fit into the machine.

## 3.2.0 Component Wiring
You can find the defined pins at the top of the .ino file.

A suggestion on wiring; components that are inside same enclosure, the same connection can be linked i.e. solder a cable to the 5v pin then take the other end and solder to the 5V of the other component, from there take one cable to the Arduino. An alternative way is to  solder similar connections and apply heat-shrink before the exit to the machine then take one wire through the machine to the Arduino.

?>Any wires going to the expansion board itself will be **26AWG**.
