> 1. Failing to run the right code branch on the chosen set of hardware will yield unexpected results.
>
> 2. Make sure you **ALWAYS** flash both the microcontroller as well as the LCD unit.

> [!TIP]
> Arduino Nano won't flash with the LCD attached to the RX/TX pins so make sure to disconnect it at that time.

# Timeline

<details>
<summary><b>Initial checks</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>


1. Purchase the parts listed from Ali and expect a wait of ~1 month.

   Any parts purchased anywhere else are done so at your own risk (they've not been tested).

2. Connect test components described in the doc to Arduino.

   Using the expansion board, twist the ends of cables and connect to the screw terminals. At this point using DuPont connections is fine but please note later we will solder to the boards or pins.

3. Flash Arduino and LCD with code.

4. Plug in and test.

   Check for a temp reading. It will contain the default offset of 7 degrees which means the initial temp will be room temp -7.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Base Install</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Plan out where the components will sit inside the machine to determine cable length
2. Create piggyback cables. Determine what switch points to piggyback from.
3. Wire in power delivery method - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
4. If you have the eco timer, disable it.
5. Swap out thermocouple - ease out the boiler (don't fully remove it) in order to gain more access.
6. Install the max temp board - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
7. Place and wire relay - attach the brew thermostat wires to the SSR relay and sit/attach the back plate or relay on the body of the machine, add some thermal paste
8. Re-Wire the steam switch for steam handling - you need to swap the brew thermostat wires (above step) for the steam thermostat wires and bridge the brew thermostat wires together then take some wires from the steam switch to the Arduino.
9. Wire brew switch for continuity
10. Test.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Extended Install</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Install the pressure sensor. Ensure it does not leak under pressure.
2. Install dimmer - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
3. Install the load cells.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Final checks</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Make sure all connections are proper i.e., no metal is exposed and well isolated, all soldering is perfect and wrapped in heat-shrink.
2. Flash the Arduino and LCD with the latest version from GitHub (there could have been changes since).
3. Record your first start. Post this to [#first-start](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/919183771079692328) on Discord.
4. Find out your regional settings and set them in the settings of the Arduino.
5. Check all other settings save correctly.
6. Record your first shot. Post this to [#first-shot](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/910972035205857320) on Discord.

# Bill of Materials
?> The current recommendation is to perform the Nano build first, after which one can easily upgrade to STM32 if further functionality is desired, jumping straight into STM32 is not encouraged for the inexperienced due to the documentation targeting a direct Nano install at this point in time.
