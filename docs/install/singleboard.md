!> The Aliexpress hose IS NOT rated as high as the original SAECO hose, please use common sense when operating the machine if you can't buy the recommended original SAECO hose use the exact size recommended here as pressure resistance is determined by the hose diameter as well.

# Considerations
!> It is expected that when going through PCB install you are able to figure out most things by yourself. Please note, these are only suggestions/food for thought/rough guidance. 

* Get rid of old harness and replace with homemade one. 
* Try to maintain the wiring for the thermal fuse and boiler terminals. If not get a resettable thermostat - **Rancilio Silvia Boiler Thermostat 165ยบ** and boiler terminals are **160783-7 TE**.
* Get covers for spades, possibly hard covers. [Printable boiler terminal covers.](https://www.printables.com/model/380256-gaggia-boiler-terminal-shroud)
* Consider buying a XH and PH JST kit to make up your own.
* Know and study difference between HV and LV lines.
* Gaggia Classic New 2018/19 - ECO board must be bypassed. Highly recommend getting PCB v3 as you can slot it into the pump tower where the eco board would be.
